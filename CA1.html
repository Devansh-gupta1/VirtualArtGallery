<h2 id="art1">The Starry Night</h2>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pd2nCUHUz4Ruc76LRh1-H0Dldl04hWSXw8P9uCYZ4TIWP7yNPArIgWlHZrf1qT9T=s1200" width="300" height="200">
<p>The Starry Night is one of Vincent van Gogh's most celebrated masterpieces, painted in 1889 during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. This oil-on-canvas work captures a swirling night sky filled with luminous stars and a glowing crescent moon, set above a peaceful village nestled among rolling hills. Dominating the foreground is a dark, flame-like cypress tree that reaches upward, bridging the earth and sky. Van Gogh's expressive brushwork and bold use of color—vivid blues, radiant yellows, and deep blacks—convey intense emotion and movement, reflecting both his fascination with the cosmos and his inner turmoil. Though the village was imagined rather than observed, the painting blends memory, imagination, and observation into a deeply personal vision of night. Today, The Starry Night is housed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York and remains a symbol of artistic genius and emotional depth.

<p>Girl with a Pearl Earring is a captivating oil painting created by Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer around 1665. Often referred to as the "Mona Lisa of the North," this artwork features a young girl dressed in an exotic blue and gold turban, with a large, luminous pearl earring that draws the viewer''s attention. Her head is turned over her shoulder, and her lips are slightly parted, giving the impression that she's about to speak or has just been interrupted—adding to the painting's mysterious allure.
Unlike traditional portraits of the time, this piece is considered a tronie—a study of a character or type rather than a specific individual. Vermeer's mastery of light and shadow, especially the soft glow on the girl's face and the reflective shimmer of the pearl, showcases his exceptional technique. The dark background enhances the subject's presence, making her appear almost three-dimensional.
Today, Girl with a Pearl Earring is housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, Netherlands, and continues to inspire countless interpretations, novels, and films. Its timeless elegance and enigmatic expression make it one of the most beloved paintings in Western art.

<p>The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506, is one of the most famous and enigmatic portraits in the world. Housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, this Renaissance masterpiece features a woman seated against a distant, dreamlike landscape. Her subtle smile, often described as mysterious or elusive, has captivated viewers for centuries.
The subject is widely believed to be Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine merchant Francesco del Giocondo—hence the painting's alternate name, La Gioconda. Da Vinci's use of sfumato, a technique that blends tones and colors without harsh lines, gives the portrait its soft, lifelike quality. Her gaze appears to follow the viewer, and the lack of eyebrows and eyelashes adds to the intrigue.
Beyond its technical brilliance, the Mona Lisa is celebrated for its psychological depth and timeless beauty. It has become a symbol of artistic excellence and cultural fascination, inspiring countless interpretations, parodies, and studies across disciplines.

<h2 id="art4">Las Meninas</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/31/Las_Meninas%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg/1200px-Las_Meninas%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez%2C_from_Prado_in_Google_Earth.jpg" alt="Las Meninas" width="250" height="200">
<p>Las Meninas is a monumental and enigmatic painting created by Diego Velázquez in 1656, during Spain’s Golden Age. Housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, this masterpiece is celebrated not just for its technical brilliance but for its complex composition and layered meanings.
The scene depicts the young Infanta Margarita Teresa, surrounded by her entourage of maids of honor (meninas), a chaperone, a bodyguard, and a pair of dwarfs. Velázquez himself appears in the painting, standing behind a large canvas, brush in hand—making this one of the earliest examples of a self-portrait within a larger narrative. In the background, a mirror reflects the image of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, suggesting they are either entering the room or being painted by Velázquez.
What makes Las Meninas so fascinating is its play with perspective, light, and viewer interaction. The painting blurs the boundaries between reality and illusion, artist and subject, viewer and participant. It invites questions: Who is being painted? Who is watching whom? Velázquez's masterful use of depth, shadow, and gaze creates a dynamic and immersive experience that has intrigued art historians for centuries.
Ultimately, Las Meninas is more than a royal portrait—it's a philosophical reflection on art itself, the role of the artist, and the nature of perception.

<h2 id="art5">The Kiss</h2>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7aJyS2Nd7c8oCJKmfXlmM-rnSnLMY0ykfBFOP8N3OjV6M4hbhS_NEg8tH6SJDfvl=s1200" alt="Handmade paper lanterns" width="300" height="200">
<p>The Kiss is a romantic and visually stunning painting created by Gustav Klimt between 1907 and 1908, during his celebrated "Golden Phase." This masterpiece is an oil painting enhanced with gold leaf, giving it a radiant, shimmering quality that has become its signature. It depicts a couple locked in a tender embrace, their bodies wrapped in elaborate, patterned robes that seem to merge into one unified form.
Set against a golden, abstract background, the painting balances intimacy with symbolism. The man gently cradles the woman's face as he kisses her cheek, while she kneels, eyes closed, in serene surrender. Klimt's use of geometric shapes—rectangles for the man and circles for the woman—suggests a harmony of masculine and feminine energies. The gold leaf and decorative motifs draw inspiration from Byzantine art, while the emotional depth reflects the influence of Symbolism and Art Nouveau.
Housed in the Belvedere Museum in Vienna, The Kiss is widely regarded as a celebration of love, sensuality, and artistic innovation. It remains one of the most beloved and recognizable paintings in the world.
